"""AGENTS.md keeps the full shared-checkout worktree rule.

A session once ran `git checkout -b` / `git checkout main` / `git branch -D`
in a shared hordeforge clone and destroyed another session's commit; it
survived only because the object was still in the object store. The rule
that came out of it — take a `git worktree` per unit of work, never switch
branches in a shared clone — cannot be enforced against git behaviour from
here, so this gate enforces the next best deterministic thing: the file
agents read carries the exact worktree commands and the complete list of
banned operations. A file that silently loses the rule is how the next
session repeats the incident. (CLAUDE.md is `@AGENTS.md`, so one file
suffices.)
