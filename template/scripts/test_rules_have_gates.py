"""The rule about rules: an incident gets a gate, and every gate is deterministic.

**A rule written as a paragraph does not hold.** When something breaks, the
repair that lasts is a check that fails — prose in AGENTS.md is read by
whoever already thought to look. So every AGENTS.md section that records a
dated incident ("Written YYYY-MM-DD", "on YYYY-MM-DD", "Decided
YYYY-MM-DD") must name a `scripts/test_*.py` that exists, or be listed in
ENFORCED_ELSEWHERE naming what enforces it instead.

**A gate that is not deterministic is not a gate.** One that depends on
iteration order, a clock, or a random seed passes and fails for reasons
unrelated to the change under test, and the first time it flaps somebody
starts ignoring it. Every other gate is therefore run twice and required to
produce byte-identical stdout.
